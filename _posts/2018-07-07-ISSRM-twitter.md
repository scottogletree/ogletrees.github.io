I recently attending the International Symposium on Society and Resource Management (ISSRM) in Snowbird, Utah. It was a great conference in a great location!

To look at one aspect of the event I collected tweets that used the conference hashtag - #ISSRM2018. Here's what I found.


# Tweet Frequency

The conference ran from June 17 through 22.
The total number of tweets collected during the conference were ___

# Original tweets and retweets

# Most retweeted tweet

# Number per day, most active day.

# Top 10 users

Wordcloud would be typical but there is a big imbalance, so show table of top 10 words/frequency in tweet text

# Top mentions of other users


# Most mentioned hashtag

# most retweeted user - who was retweeted the most?

A network diagram would be nifty. https://briatte.github.io/ggnet/  http://kateto.net/network-visualization  https://dicook.github.io/WOMBAT/slides/yanchang.pdf  http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/33-social-network-analysis/136-network-analysis-and-manipulation-using-r/

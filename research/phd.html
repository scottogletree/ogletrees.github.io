<body><h1>Dissertation Research</h1>
<h3>Project</h3>
<p>The project for my dissertation will be looking at the relationship between urban greenspaces and crime. There has been a growing interest in how urban greenspace impacts people and cities, from public health to social behavior. I will be investigating this topic through mapping and statistical tools to help measure if the relationship exists with crime.</p>
<p>Greenspaces can include parks, gardens, forests, road medians, or any other green vegetation in the city. It is thought that these places help improve the quality of life for residents. Over time people have believed that shrubs and plants could provide hiding places for criminals, but more research has shown many benefits from trees and natural places in cities.</p>
<p>Some coverage of the issue can be found at these sites:</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>As part of my research I will specifically be looking at these questions</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the relationship between urban greenspace and crime?</li>
<li>Does urban greenspace moderate the relationship between temperature and crime?</li>
<li>How does proximity to urban parks influence the relationship between greenspace and crime?</li>

</ul>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>The first part of my work will look at how greenspaces and crime might be related across a number of different cities. I will be investigating cities with populations over 100,000 (300 in total). Measuring greenspace with satellite images, I will see if crime and vegetation are related and how that relationship varies between cities. Differing temperatures and precipitation can have a big impact on how much greenspace a city has, so I will be including these in my analysis.</p>
<p>Work has shown that temperatures have an impact on the amount of violent crime, with more crime in high temperatures. Since greenspaces can help cool neighborhoods, the second part of my research will look at the interactions between temperatures, greenspace, and crime. I will measure the local weather through combining temperature with humidity, wind, and sun. This will better represent how we feel local weather conditions. This part of the project will look at both greenspaces and urban parks specifically.</p>
<p>In the final part I will zoom in to a few cities to see how parks relate to scenic crime locations. I hope to see how being closer to or farther from parks influences the amount of crime.</p>
<p>This research will involve a large amount of data from satellites, the US Census, and weather stations. I hope that it will paint a more complete picture of how parks and greenspaces relate to crime and to the city. Through a better understanding of the role that green and natural places play, we can aim to create cities that contribute to the overall well-being of residents.</p>

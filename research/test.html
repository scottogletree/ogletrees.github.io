<body><h1>Dissertation Research</h1>
<p>I am currently taking comprehensive exams before starting on my dissertation research.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Project</h2>
<p>I will be looking at the relationship between urban greenspaces and crime. There has been a growing interest in how urban greenspace impacts people and cities, from public health to social behavior. I will be examining this topic through spatial analysis tools to help quantify if the relationship exists with crime.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is the relationship between urban greenspace and crime?</li>
<li>Does urban greenspace moderate the relationship between temperature and crime?</li>
<li>How does proximity to urban parks influence the relationship between greenspace and crime?</li>

</ul>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>Look at <em>cities with population over 100,000</em></p>
<p>Thermal comfort is a way to account for how people experience the environment. I will measure this through a thermal comfort index.</p>

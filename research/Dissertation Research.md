# Dissertation Research

I am currently taking comprehensive exams before starting on my dissertation research.



## Project

I will be looking at the relationship between urban greenspaces and crime. There has been a growing interest in how urban greenspace impacts people and cities, from public health to social behavior. I will be examining this topic through spatial analysis tools to help quantify if the relationship exists with crime.



### Questions

1. What is the relationship between urban greenspace and crime?
2. Does urban greenspace moderate the relationship between temperature and crime?
3. How does proximity to urban parks influence the relationship between greenspace and crime?

### Methods

Look at *cities with population over 100,000*

Thermal comfort is a way to account for the way that people experience the environment. I will measure this through a thermal comfort index.

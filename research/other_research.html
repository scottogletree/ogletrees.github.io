      <li><em>more to come...</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Areas of further interest</h4>

      <h2>Other Research</h2>
<h4>#FindYourPark Online: Social Media and the National Park Service Centennial</h4>
<p>Currently writing an article on the analysis of the National Park Service's social media campaign to increase outreach in conjunction with the 2016 Centennial. Based on the analysis of social media using the hashtag #FindYourPark. Work was presented at the 2017 George Wright Society Conference in Norfolk, VA.</p>

<h4>Mountain Bike Deserts</h4>
<p>This work is based off of the simple question of "where are mountain bike trails in the USA?" Using GPS trail data scraped from social sharing websites, trails are mapped for the continental USA. Areas are identified for spatial analysis. Work was presented at the International Adventure Conference in Tralee, Ireland.</p>

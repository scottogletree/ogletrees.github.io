      <h1>Other Research</h1>
      <p>The project for my dissertation will be looking at the relationship between urban greenspaces and crime. There has been a growing interest in how urban greenspace impacts people and cities, from public health to social behavior. I will be investigating this topic through mapping and statistical tools to help measure if the relationship exists with crime.</p>
      <p>Greenspaces can include parks, gardens, forests, road medians, or any other green vegetation in the city. It is thought that these places help improve the quality of life for residents. Over time people have believed that shrubs and plants could provide hiding places for criminals, but more research has shown many benefits from trees and natural places in cities.</p>
      <p>Some coverage of the issue can be found at these sites:</p>

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p><strong>Things I'm interested in:</strong><br>
Broadly I am curious about how our environment, both natural and designed, influences the places we live, work, and play. I have an keen interest in how people interact with the wider world through the recreational activities they pursue. This interest comes from my own enjoyment of being outdoors and participating in activities such as hiking, biking, paddlesports, and exploring. Sometimes I just like to lie around in a hammock too.<br>
<br>
I also enjoy making things and solving problems.<br>
<br>
<strong>Some things I've done in the past</strong><br>
Having taken a less than traditional path through education and employment, I have had the opportunity to do many different things over the years.<br>
<br></p>
			<ul>
<li>Received a Bachelors degree from the University of Georgia</li>
<li>Lived and worked in Ethiopia. Managed a national staff there and oversaw construction projects down country.</li>
<li>Traveled the USA promoting outdoor equipment for a small company, Lotus Designs, and a big one, Patagonia.</li>
<li>Have been a rock climber, kayaker, and mountain biker at different times in life</li>
			</ul>	
<p><strong>I have expertise in...</strong><br>
Adobe Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign), GIS, R, SPSS, Mac & PC, QGIS, ArcGIS (desktop & online), Tableau, research methods (more quantitative than qualitative), data visualization, photography, video, elementary web design, a little residual expertise in CAD (mostly Vectorworks). Also know how to weld and build stuff. Fixing things too (like bikes & cars).</p>

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p><strong>Things I'm interested in:</strong><br>
Broadly I am curious about how our environment, both natural and designed, influences the places we live, work, and play. I have a keen interest in how people interact with the wider world through the recreational activities they pursue. This interest comes from my own enjoyment of being outdoors and participating in activities such as hiking, biking, paddlesports, and exploring. Sometimes I just like to lie around in a hammock too.<br>
<br>
I also enjoy making things and solving problems.<br>
<br>
